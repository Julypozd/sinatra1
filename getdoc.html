    <p1>As America changes, the tech industry has been slow to keep up. 
    Over half of children born today are minorities, and 1 in 4 have an immigrant parent. 
    Yet Silicon Valley and the U.S. tech economy remain remarkably non-diverse. 
    That amounts to a lot of missed opportunities for all of us. 
    Code the Dream offers free intensive training in software development to people from diverse low-income backgrounds. 
    In CTD Labs, our coders work with experienced mentors to hone those skills by building apps and technology platforms for 
    a range of startups, nonprofits and government clients. The ultimate aim of Code the Dream is to create a unique win-win, 
    where our coders gain real experience building apps that make the world a little better place, and then use that experience 
    to launch new careers with enormous opportunity for themselves, their families, and their communities.</p1>
